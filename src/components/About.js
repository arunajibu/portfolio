      I'm Aruna, a full-stack and front-end developer with expertise in 
      building responsive, user-centric web applications. Skilled in HTML, CSS, 
      JavaScript, React, PHP, and MySQL, I bring both creative design and robust 
      back-end solutions to the table.

        Currently, I am expanding my skills through a training program in ServiceNow, 
        which is helping me gain experience in enterprise-level service management solutions. 
        In addition to that, I am actively developing my personal skills in React by working on 
        various personal projects.

        My focus is on crafting seamless, intuitive interfaces while ensuring the performance and 
        scalability of the underlying systems. Whether it's enhancing the user experience, 
        optimizing server-side functionality, or exploring new technologies, 
        I thrive on solving complex challenges with elegant solutions.
